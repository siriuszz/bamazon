MySQL and Node.js Virtual Storefront

This application displays items in inventory, along with the price of each. 

The user makes a product selection and indicates quantity desired.

The application will then check the database, determine if there is enough stock to fill the order, and respond accordingly.

If the order can be filled, the price is tallied and presented to the user.

Additionally, the db is updated with the new quantities.
